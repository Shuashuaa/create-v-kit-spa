# Contributing

Thanks for being willing to contribute!

## Project setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. `npm install` to install dependencies
3. `npm run validate` to validate you've got it working
4. Create a branch for your PR

> Tip: Keep your `main` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/Shuashuaa/v-kit-spa.git 
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `main`
> branch to use the upstream main branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `main` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `main`, do a regular `git pull`.

Also, please watch the repo and respond to questions/bug reports/feature
requests! Thanks!
